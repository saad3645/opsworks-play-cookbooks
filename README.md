# Description

Chef cookbook for deploying applications written with [Play framework](http://www.playframework.com/) on Amazon's AWS [OpsWorks](http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/). Play applications are deployed as services. Attributes can be configured to customize installation and deployment.

  
This cookbook is experimental and a work in progress until otherwise mentioned. Please test vigorously if you use this in a production environment. Otherwise Bon App√©tit. :)


## Platform

- Amazon Linux
- Ubuntu 12.04*


## Cookbooks

This cookbook depends on the following cookbooks:
- [java](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/java)
- [deploy](https://github.com/aws/opsworks-cookbooks/tree/release-chef-11.4/deploy) (AWS OpsWorks)


## Usage

1. Create a new Stack.
   - Click on the "Advance" link and choose **Use custom Chef cookbooks**.
   - In the Repository Url field enter `https://github.com/saad3645/opsworks-play-cookbooks.git`, or if you forked this repo use the url for your repo instead.
   - Optionally add some custom JSON. Please refer to the [Attributes](#attributes) section below for example usage.
2. Create a new custom layer:
   - Add `opsworks_play2::setup` to the setup lifecyle event recipes
   - Add `opsworks_play2::deploy` to the deploy lifecyle event recipes
   - Start a new instance
3. Add your Play application to the stack, and deploy it.

**Example usage**

You can specify a global deploy JSON, for every app in your Stack. Provide a custom JSON like the one below while creating your Stack:

```json
{
  "play": {
    "application": {
      "options": {
	    "http": {"port": "80"},
        "https": {"port": "443"},
	    "config": {
	      "resource": "production.conf",
		  "file": null,
		  "url": null
	    },
	    "logger": {
	      "resournce": "conf/production_logger.xml",
		  "file": null,
		  "url": null
	    }
	  }
    }
  }
}
```

<br/>
Alternatively you can override the deploy attributes for each individual app. Simply supply a custom JSON when you add a new App, for each app you want to customize:

```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "<app_name>": {
      "play": {
		"options": {
		  "http": {"port": "80"},
		  "https": {"port": "443"},
		  "config": {
		    "resource": "production.conf",
			"file": null,
			"url": null
		  },
		  "logger": {
		    "resournce": "conf/production_logger.xml",
			"file": null,
			"url": null
		  }
		}
	  }
	}
  }
}
```

If you want you can provide a global deploy json at the beginning when you create your Stack, and then again override individual apps using a second json for each app you want to customize.
