Description
===========

Chef cookbook for deploying applications written with [Play framework](http://www.playframework.com/) on Amazon's AWS [OpsWorks](http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/). Play applications are deployed as services. Attributes can be configured to customize installation and deployment.

  
This cookbook is experimental and a work in progress until otherwise mentioned. Please test vigorously if you use this in a production app. Otherwise Bon App√©tit. :)


Platform
--------
- Amazon Linux
- Ubuntu 12.04*


Cookbooks
---------

This cookbook depends on the following cookbooks:
- [java](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/java)
- [deploy](https://github.com/aws/opsworks-cookbooks/tree/release-chef-11.4/deploy) (AWS OpsWorks)


Attributes

**Deploying a Play app**

|Key                      |Type    |Description                |Default|

|`options.config.resource`|`String`|The alternative configuration file to be loaded from the application classpath (usually in /conf). Has higher precedence than `config.file` and `config.url`, which means that if this attribute is supplied, then the other two will be ignored.|`nil`|
|`options.config.file`    |`String`|The alternative configuration file to be loaded from outside the application package. Has higher precedence than `config.url`.|`nil`| 
|`options.config.url`     |`String`|The alternative configuration file to be loaded from an URL.|`nil`|
|`options.logger.resource`|`String`|The alternative logback configuration file to be loaded from the application classpath. Has higher precedence than `logger.file` and `logger.url`, which means that if this attribute is supplied, then the other two will be ignored.|`nil`|
|`options.logger.file`    |`String`|The alternative logback configuration file to be loaded from the file system. Has higher precedence that `logger.url`.|`nil`|
|`options.logger.url`     |`String`|The alternative logback configuration file to be loaded from an URL.|`nil`|

**Usage**

```json
{
  "play": {
    "deploy": {
      "options": {
	    "http": {
          "port": "80"
	    },
        "https": {
	      "port": "443"
	    },
	    "config": {
	      "resource": "production.conf",
		  "file": null,
		  "url": null
	    },
	    "logger": {
	      "resournce": "conf/production_logger.xml",
		  "file": null,
		  "url": null
	    }
	  }
    }
  }
}
```

<br/>
Alternatively if you want to customize each individual app, you can specify the deploy attributes for each app in your stack:

```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "<app_name>": {
      "play": {
		"options": {
		  "http": {
		    "port": "80"
		  },
		  "https": {
		    "port": "443"
		  },
		  "config": {
		    "resource": "production.conf",
			"file": null,
			"url": null
		  },
		  "logger": {
		    "resournce": "conf/production_logger.xml",
			"file": null,
			"url": null
		  }
		}
	  }
	}
  }
}
```

The second json will override the deploy attributes in the first for that app only. In other words if you specify the deploy attributes for an individual app, it will override anything you specified in your gloabl deploy attributes for that app only.
